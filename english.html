	<br>
Short Story Collection is the culmination of a passion for story telling in the written form. Middleton has penned four stories: Direct Action, an unlikely friendship between a down-and-out and a farmer results in an unlikely resolution for the latter's hardships; Eugene's First Vacation and The Journey Home, three stories bridged by the same protagonist,

<p id="text">a modest man from the American Deep South and his first online dating experience; and Stephen Harper's Gift, a tale of a bank robbery and the soluble paradigm of morals; each covering themes of justice, redemption and endurance, each story revealing everyday heroes within seemingly ordinary men, offering beacons of hope in dark times. Short Story Collection is equal parts wit and humour, Middleton's style and diction adaptable to the environment he transports the pen to and a masterclass in the art of suspense; in this instance, short is shorthand for powerful.</p>  <br>

<p id="text1"> world unknown, a world unseen, a world in another dimension. This story is about a young girl who had to learn that everything isn’t always as it seems and that some things may remain hidden for your protection and in other times need to be revealed, in order to save you. 

“The world we see and experience with our natural senses is not the reality that really exists. This short novel gives us a peek into the life of a supernatural child, the world of mental illness and the battle that rages between light and darkness. As a prophet of God, with many supernatural experiences and the gift of spiritual sight, I could relate to all that was said in this piece, yet I am not sure if it was my experience of this sort of reality that had me on the edge of my seat or the story that I was reading. Come and join Jessica, a young girl that will open up this brave new world to you the reader.” </p>  <br>
